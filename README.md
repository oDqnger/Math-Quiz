# Math-Quiz
A math quiz made in C#. A CLI program.

# How to run this
If you want to try this game out for yourself (which I highly doubt), all you need to do is download dotnet and configure it, you know the deal. Then you download the file, put it wherever you want it to be and then run the file in the command prompt by navigating to the folder you downloaded it in and typing the command, "dotnet run." If there are any issues with this or with the download, please do inform me.
